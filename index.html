            <h1>CRAGMAW CASTLE</h1>
            <p>The Cragmaw tribe consists of marauding bands and rival goblinholds scattered throughout the area of the
                Triboar
                Trail and the Neverwinter Wood.
                However, one chieftain is grudgingly recognized by all others as supreme: King Grol of Cragrnaw Castle.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Cragmaw Castle</strong>is not a goblin construction, nor is
                that the structure's original name. Raised by a talented
                wizard-noble of old Phalorm, an ancient realm that once
                controlled much of the North, the stronghold consists of
                seven overlapping towers; however, its upper levels have
                long since collapsed to heaps of crumbling masonry. Only the ground floor is still sound enough to be
                habitable.</p>
            <h1>GENERAL FEATURES</h1>
            <p>The centuries have not been kind to Cragmaw Castle.
            The goblins have shored up the weakest areas beneath its falling towers with crude timbers, but it's only
            a matter of time before the structure collapses completely.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ceilings.</b> Ceilings are 15 feet high unless noted otherwise.</li>
                <li><b>Doors.</b> Interior doors are made of wood reinforced with iron bands. They have neitherlocks nor keyholes.
                    It takes a successful <strong style="color: maroon;">DC 15 Strength check</strong> to break down a door that is barricaded shut.</li>
                <li><b>Floors.</b> Cracked and uneven flagstones conceal a dirt floor underneath.</li>
                <li><b>Light.</b> A small amount of natural light filters through the 
                arrow slits around the castle. During the day, this provides dim light in most areas. At night, all areas are dark.</li>
                <li><b>Walls.</b> Exterior walls and load-bearing interior walls
                are 5 feet thick, with 3 feet of mortared fill sandwiched 
                between 1-foot-thick courses of hard stone blocks. Interior 
                walls are I-foot-thick worked stone.
                Arrow slits in the castle walls are 10 feet above the outside ground level, 4 feet above the 
                interior floor level, 8 inches wide, and 4 feet high. <strong style="color: maroon;">A creature on one side of an arrow slit 
                gains three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side (see "Cover" in the rulebook).</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h1>1. CASTLE ENTRANCE</h1>
                <p>The main gates between areas 1 and 2 are made
                    of bronze-covered wood,<br>but they are corroded
                    and collapsed.</p>
                <div class="picWrapper">
                    <p class="readAloud">The castle consists of seven crumbling towers of different
                        sizes and heights, but the upper stories are all in varying
                        states of collapse. A short flight of steps leads up to a terrace
                        in front of the main entryway. Past the wreckage of a pair of
                        sundered doors lies a shadowed hall. Round towers loom
                        over the entranceway, with dark arrow slits looking down on the terrace.</p>
                    <img src="roomimgs/room-1.jpg" alt="room1" class="roomPic">
                </div>
                <p><b>No monsters dwell here,</b> <span class="highlight">but the goblin sentries in area
                    3 are supposed to be keeping watch.</span> They glance only occasionally out of the arrow slits, however, 
                    so characters who move quietly might be able to creep past them. 
                    Have each character make a <b>Dexterity (Stealth) check.</b> <em>The lowest check is the DC for the goblins' Wisdom 
                    checks to notice the party.</em></p>
                <h3>DEVELOPMENTS</h3>
                <p>If the goblins spot the characters(or if the characters approach openly), the goblins shoot arrows from behind the 
                    arrow slits. <strong>However, they can't fire directly at enemies at or past the broken gate.</strong> The goblins also shout loudly
                    enough to alert their comrades in areas 4 and 6 that the castle is under attack.</p>

            <h1>2. TRAPPED HALL</h1>
            <p>Once the castle's foyer, this wide hall makes a dangerous battleground.</p>
            <div class="picWrapper">
                <p class="readAloud">Doors stand closed to the north and south, with a crumbling
                    mound of rubble partially obscuring the southern hall.
                    To the east, a broad corridor ends in two more doors leading south and east. The corridor is cluttered
                    with dusty rubble and fallen plaster from a partial collapse of the ceiling overhead.</p>
                <img src="roomimgs/room-2.jpg" alt="room2" class="roomPic">
            </div>
            <p>If the goblin sentries in area 3 raised the alarm, the
                goblins and hobgoblins in areas 4 and 6 come running out 
                of the north and south doors at the same time. They attack from both directions, 
                trying to overwhelm the adventurers and drive them out of the castle.</p>
            <p class="hazard"><strong>Trap</strong>. The dusty plaster and rubble in front of the door leading to area 8 conceals a copper tripwire connected
                to linchpins hidden in the ruined ceiling. Spotting the tripwire requires a passive <b>Wisdom (Perception) score of 
                at least 20, or a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)</b>> check if characters are actively searching for traps in the area. 
                Once spotted, the tripwire is easily avoided and disarmed (no ability check required).</p>
            <p>Any creature that walks over or through the rubble without avoiding the tripwire triggers a cave-in of wooden beams and heavy stones. 
                (The area of the collapse is marked on the map.) Any creature in the area when the trap triggers <span class="highlight"><b>must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or 
                take 3d6 bludgeoning damage from the falling rubble (half as much damage on a successful save). 
                The noise of the collapse puts the monsters in areas 3, 7, 8, and 9 on alert.</b></span></p>

            <p>Cragmaw Castle's main defenses are its secret location and the appearance of having

                back to Phandalin and then venture to Wave Echo Cave to learn the fate of his brothers, Nundro and Tharden. He knows that someone called
                the Black Spider orchestrated his capture and hopes that the characters stop the villain. Upon returning to Phandalin, Gundren offers the 
                characters <strong>25 gp each for their assistance and promises the party a 10 percent share of the mine's wealth once his operation there is up and running.</strong><br>
                Whether the characters sought the information from Agatha or Reidoth, negotiated with Hamun Kost, or recovered Gundren and his map from Cragmaw Castle, they now know the location of Wave Echo Cave. The only thing left for them to do is seek 
                out the old dwarven delve and discover for themselves who the Black Spider is, and why he's so interested in the Lost Mine of Phandelver.</p>

            <p class="hazard">Gundren is weak and tells the charachters that "The bugbear kept my map somewhere in this room. We've got to find it." He then offers them the Phandalin 
                escort deal. After the party has rested and is on thier way back they are met with a hobgoblin war band. This war band consists of <strong>three hobgoblins led by <span style="color: maroon;">Targor Bloodsword, a hobgoblin with 20 hit points.</span> 
                Targor also has two wolves as pets.</strong>Gundren will be killed during this battle or die from previous wounds.<br>
                On the way back during a camping trip the party will be attacked by the Stirges. Other then that the trip back to Phandelin will be mostly uneventful. Maybe throw
                in a harmless but weird road encounter. Upon return the Harbin Wester(the townmaster) will send for Sildar for a meeting and will talk him into staying behind to 
                head the constabulary. When the PC's return to sister Garael she will tell them to go to the tavern and she will send a <strong>second-level cleric to join them.</strong>
